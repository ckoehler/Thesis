----------------------------------------

amermeteorsoc.bst is included for making the bibliography
amermeteorsoc.bst is produced by by typing: latex amermeteorsoc.dbj

It is possible to edit amermeteorsoc.dbj to attempt minor changes.
Or you can make you own .dbj file by typing: latex makebst
Then answer a couple of dozen questions, (hitting return
accepts the default answer).

OUdissertation.cls was upgraded on March 3, 2004 to print names under
signature lines

minor change March 1, 2006: \bibpunct added to disser.tex 

OUdisseration2.cls replaces OUdisseration.cls on July 10, 2006.
But the obsolete doublespace.sty is now included, so using
OUdisseration.cls is still an option (but as of July 13, it is
not recommended, because of margin problems and spacing problems
that are repaired in OUdissertation2.cls).

On April 19, 2007 some minor changes were made to the title, signature
and copyright pages.  Those pages now conform better with the
standards of the OU Graduate College (but the font size etc. does
not look as nice). 

April 22, 2007: A working example of an appendix is included (after
uncommenting the appropriate lines).

November 25, 2007: pagenumber is removed from dedication page. Fontsizes
in title page are now downgraded to look like a 1970's IBM selectric typewriter,
to conform with Graduate College specifications. :(

Decmeber 8, 2008: chapter heading etc. margins fixed by Jeremy Gibbs

April 21, 2009: revised procedure for including the optional Dedication page.
