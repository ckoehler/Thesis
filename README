This thesis is built using the MacTex package, available at http://www.tug.org/mactex/2011/.
For continuous building during editing, I used the excellent latexmk PERL script.
The PDF reader that allows automatic updates as the PDF is rebuilt is called Skim.

All the .tex files and the references.bib file are Copyright 2011 Christoph Koehler. They are given simply as an example on how one
may format a thesis. You may not copy any content without proper attribution. Be smart, be nice.

See the individual files for credit and author information. I am indebted to their work which made it
fairly simple for me to get all this working!
