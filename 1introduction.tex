This thesis will focus on the following topics.

In order to evaluate a waveform, we will use the Ambiguity Function (AF). It shows the spatial delay in one
dimension and Doppler velocity in the other dimension. The third dimension shows how much energy of the signal
is contained at any delay-velocity combination.

We will then compare binary codes with frequency modulated waveforms based on their AFs. We will compare the
AFs of different waveforms with varying pulse lengths and modulations.

After that, the effects of impulse response distortion on the waveform's AF will be examined.

Finally, we will include volume scattering into the calculations.
