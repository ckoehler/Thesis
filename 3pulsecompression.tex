\subsection{Linear Frequency Modulation}
\label{s_lfm}
In Pulse Compression, the frequency inside the pulse is modulated linearly (for Linear FM, or LFM) or
non-linearly over a certain bandwidth. It is defined as:
\begin{equation}
\label{LFM}
x(t) = e^{j \pi \beta t^2 } = e^{j \theta (t)},\ \ 0 \leq t \leq \tau
\end{equation}

The spectrum of such a LFM waveform approaches the shape of a rectangle that becomes better defined
as the $\beta\tau$ ratio increases. The matched filter response of a rectangular waveform is a sinc 
function with Rayleigh resolution of approximately $1/\beta$ (\cite{Richards:2005}).


The result is an increase in the ambiguous range $r_a$.

The LFM effect is a consequence of a Ambiguity Function property, as follow:

If $u(t)$ has an added phase that changes quadratically, i.e. $u^{'}(t) = u(t) e^{j\pi \beta t^2}$, which 
is equivalent to a linear frequency modulation because $\omega(t) = \frac{d}{dt}\phi(t)$, the resulting 
AF is $|\chi(\tau,f_d-k\tau)|$.

The slow drop-off of peak in the AF makes LFM pulse compression very Doppler tolerant, which make it convenient 
for radar applications that have to deal with high-velocity targets. Add to that the ease of implementation in 
analog hardware and we have a simple way to improve our radar's performance.

\subsection{Non-linear Frequency Modulation}
Extrapolating from the results above, the general expression for a frequency modulated waveform is as follows.

\begin{equation}
\label{NLFM}
x(t) = e^{j 2 \pi \int_0^t{f(t') dt'}} ,\ \ 0 \leq t \leq \tau,
\end{equation}

where $f(t)$ defines the function of the frequency sweep. In the LFM case, $f(t)=\beta t$, which simplifies Eq
\ref{NLFM} to

\begin{equation}
\label{NLFM_simp}
x(t) = e^{j 2 \pi \int_0^t{f(t') dt'}} =  e^{j 2 \pi \frac{\beta t^2}{2}} = e^{j \pi \beta t^2},
\end{equation}

which validates our initial claim that a quadratic phase modulation corresponds to a linear frequency change.

\subsection{Military Radars' use of Frequency Modulation} 
Since LFM is simply taking advantage of a property of the AF, it was the earliest way of getting increased sensitivity.
It's fairly simple to implement in analog hardware and very Doppler tolerant due to the slow decrease in slope, making it
a popular choice for early radars that had to detect fast moving targets.


\section{Amplitude Modulation}
One way to bring down undesired sidelobes is to weight the amplitude of the signal such that less energy is transmitted
towards the edges of the signal. However, this has a couple of downsides. First, not as much energy is transmitted onto the
target because the amplifier doesn't put out as much power for a weighted amplitude waveform as it would for a 
rectangular pulse. This results in a lower SNR and can impact rate of detection. Second, the mainlobe is broadened,
resulting in a decrease in spatial resolution.

\section{Phase Modulation}
\subsection{Binary Codes}
Binary codes vary the phase of the signal in increments of $\pi$. 
The most commonly known phase code is a Barker code, which is believed to exist up to a length of 13. The Barker 13 code
looks like +1 +1 +1 +1 +1 −1 −1 +1 +1 −1 +1 −1 +1. It's called a "perfect" code because its autocorrelation has a main lobe 
of 13 and sidelobes of no more than 1.

\subsection{n-ary Codes}
Instead of varying the phase of the signal between only 0 and $\pi$, they can be varied arbitrarily between 0 and $2\pi$ in
an attempt to gain a better performing code.

\subsubsection{Bandwidth for Binary Phase Codes}
The bandwidth of a binary phase-modulated waveform is the inverse of the length of a subpulse. Given a
pulse with length $\tau$ and $n$ subpulses, the length of a subpulse is $T = \frac{\tau}{n}$, the bandwidth
of the whole pulse will be $B = \frac{1}{T}$ Hz.
