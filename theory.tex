\section{Correlation Function}

\section{Fixed Target}

\section{Moving Target}
Show that/if Doppler effects are negligible for weather.
Speeds are only +- 50m/s

\section{Volume Scattering}

\section{Transmitter transfer function}
Amplitude and phase, linear and quadratic, Gaussian pulse.
How does transfer function operating region change pulse compression?
