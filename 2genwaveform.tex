\section{Continuous Wave}
Continuous wave (CW) radars will not be considered here and only be mentioned briefly. These bistatic
radars continuosly transmit a wave from one antenna and receive with another. While they have many uses,
their use in weather observation is almost non-existant.
\section{Pulsed Radar}
The basic pulsed radar emits many pulses of duration $\tau$ towards the target by switching the transmitter
on for $\tau$ s and then off to transmit any returns for a significantly longer time compared to $\tau$.
