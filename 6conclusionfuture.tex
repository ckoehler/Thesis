\section{Conclusions}
This work examined several different techniques of pulse compression and evaluated their performance 
in regards to weather radar applications. 
It looks like the waveform with the best performance is a NLFM signal with 
$a=xxxx$ and amplitude tapering.


\section{Future Work}
There are several ways to improve on this work in the future.

First, other waveform can be evaluated based on the presented metrics, like more complex
phase coded signals. Other sweeping functions than the one presented could be evaluated
to perhaps find waveforms that perform better for weather radar applications.

Second, the effects of the amplifier impulse response and other system components
chould be better quantified and the results compared with the theoretical
results that are expected. Particularly, attempts to correct for the distortion caused by the
impulse response could be presented. One possible candidate is pulse pre-distortion that will cancel
out the distortion caused in the receive chain.
