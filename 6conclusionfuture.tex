\section{Conclusions}
Conclusion here. 

It looks like the waveform with the best performance is a NLFM signal with 
$a=xxxx$ and amplitude weighting.


\section{Future Work}
Other, more complex waveforms could be evaluated to get even better 
performance.

The effects of the amplifier impulse response and other system components
should be better quantified and the results compared with the theoretical
results we expect.
