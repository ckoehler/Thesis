The simulation is done in multiple parts. First, a waveform is generated based on a given
amplitude, phase, frequency modulation, and impulse response that is applied to the signal.
The returned waveform is properly sampled based on the desired signal bandwidth to avoid aliasing.
Once we have the waveform, we generate the AF and plot it as a surface plot.

\section{Optimizations}
We optimize the waveform on Integrated Sidelobe Level (ISL) and peak sidelobe.

- fixed, motion, volume scattering, transfer function, quantization effects
- nlfm, paramterized as polynomial
