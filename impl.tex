\section{Finding Performant Codes}
For our implementation, we chose quadrature codes of length 13, for a total of $4^{13} = 67108864$ possible codes.
We then calculate the ISL (\ref{ISL}) for each code to determine how well it performs in respect to pulse compression,
and keep the best 4000 codes.

In the next step, we test each code with every other code to determine their orthoganality, measuring their performance.
We evaluate the best performing codes and implement them in the PX1000 mobile radar.
